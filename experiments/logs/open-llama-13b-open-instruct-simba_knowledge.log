We'll flip a coin and try one of these, in order to fail forward.
Either way, this might cause trouble in the future:
If you get `CUDA error: invalid device function` errors, the above might be the cause and the solution is to make sure only one ['libcudart.so', 'libcudart.so.11.0', 'libcudart.so.12.0'] in the paths that we search based on your env.
